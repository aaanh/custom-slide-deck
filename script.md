Welcome everyone to my workshop. I hope you have your tea ready.

While you can definitely sit back, relax, and enjoy the show should you prefer, let's try to step out of our comfort zones and interact with each other for the fullest experience.

First of all, I would like to thank the sponsors of UpStart 2024, here they are on the screen.

Alright let's hop right into it.

The name of this workshop is "Practical Crash Course to UI/UX for Business Products".

Ok, so why should we care?

When we have an idea of a product, we usually think of how much utility it provides for your potential users or customers. And then we put on some elbow grease and jump right into building the product.

We are inclined to think that the utility of the product will be the main attraction to potential customers and would be the primary force driving lead generation and user retention. Our customers would love to pay money to use our wonderful and innovative product.

Well, I'm here to change our mind.

But who am I to dare to try and do so?

My name is Anh and I am the VP of Technology at GCES.

I have experience working both in user-facing roles, receiving feedbacks and implementing improvements; and in more backend, infrastructure development roles, building high-performing, resilient, and secured cloud services.

I also develop and maintain the GCES website. So I could say that I know something about UI/UX to give my two cents.
